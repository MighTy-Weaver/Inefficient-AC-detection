This is the code repository for the paper _____________________, you can find the paper directly through **[here](https://www.google.com)**


## 1. Environment Setup
The experiment is conducted under: Windows 10 with Python 3.7/3.8 as the developing environment.

Use `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all the packages. 

**In short, You must have `xgboost, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, pandas, shap, warnings` installed.**

## 2. Data Compilation
We provide the compiled version of our experiment data `data_compiled.csv`. All the raw source data can be accessed through this **[link](https://www.google.com)**

The data is compiled by Python and the code is released in the folder `dataCompilation`.

You might need to modify some path to make it work. Or you can simply use our compiled version.

## 3. Training the XGBoost Model

Again, you must have all the packages above installed.
